# Step 5: Set preferences for receiving notifications

Complete the following steps to set your preferences for receiving various types of notifications:

1. To receive notifications about IBM Cloud platform-related, or resource-related items, go to the Avatar icon **Avatar** icon ![Avatar Logo](images/i-avatar-icon.png) **Profile > Notification preferences**.

   - When you set IBM Cloud platform notifications, you receive email notifications that are associated with only the platform. 
     You do not receive notifications about events that are associated with IBM Cloud services. By default, all platform notifications 
	 are turned off.
   - If you update your preferences on resource activity, such as incidents, maintenance, security bulletins, or infrastructure service updates, 
     the notifications are for only the services you use or the devices that you have provisioned. By default, all infrastructure notifications 
	 are turned off.
